# American Statistical Association DataFest 2023
The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest is a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. The hackathon features two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, and each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. Prizes are given for Best Insight, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.
